## Authentication

Unauthenticated users are directed to a login page, where they can use third-party Single Sign On (SSO) providers like Google or Github.

This project uses the third-party NPM package [next-auth](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-auth) for authentication.

## Home Page

Once authenticated, users are welcomed with a personalized message based on their login information.

## Features

The application provides the following features:

### Profile

Clicking on the "Profile" option in the menu takes users to their personal profile page. Here, they can view and edit their profile information.

### Astronauts

Selecting the "Astronauts" option from the menu displays a table of the current astronauts in space. The table includes two columns: "Astronaut Name" and "Craft" they are located on.
